Hi hi 👋

This page is about me, *mofrim*.

For the last 2-3 years i have been studying software development, officially at
42 Programming School in Wolfsburg / Germany and a lot more at home, on a train,
somewhere else, using all the wonderful free resources the internet has to
offer, whenever i can.

My main interests / skills are:

- OpenSource Software / FreeSoftware Movement
- C / C++ (in the future Rust), Python, Linux system programming
- Webdev (Typescript, React, FastAPI, C++ backends)
- DevOps (NixOS, Ansible, Docker)
- Cyber-Security
- Math (yes, i am still trying to finish my BSc along the way 🤪)

...and guess what? I also like doing quite some things that are not at all
related to computers, like rock climbing, mountaineering 🏔️, ski touring ⛷ ;)


I consider myself a learner in all fields because most tech fields seem relevant
to me today.

### how you can contact me:

- code repositories:
  - [mofrim@GitHub](https://github.com/mofrim)
  - [mofrim@codeberg](https://codeberg.org/mofrim)
- @mofrim anywhere else.
