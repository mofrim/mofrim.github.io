Hi hi üëã

This is page is about me, *mofrim*.

ATM i study software development, officially at 42 Programming School in
Wolfsburg / Germany and a lot more at home, on a train, somewhere else using all
wonderful free ressource the internet offers, whenever i can.

May main interests / Skills are:

- OpenSource Software / FreeSoftware Movement
- C / C++ (in the future Rust), Python, Linux system programming
- Webdev (Typescript, React, FastAPI, C++ backends)
- DevOps (NixOS, Ansible, Docker, CI/CD)
- Cyber-Security
- Math (yes, i am still trying to finish my BSc along the way ;)

...and guess what? I also like doing quite some things that are not at all
related to computers, like rock climbing, mountaineering üèîÔ∏è, ski touring ‚õ∑ ;)


I consider myself a learner in all fields because most tech fields seem relevant
to me today.
