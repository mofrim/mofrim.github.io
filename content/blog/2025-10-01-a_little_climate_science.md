This is a **biased** selection of months where a declining trend in total
precipitation sum for **only one** weather-station near Göttingen can be found.
This is still heavy WIP and has **no** scientific significance so far.

I am working on this in order to double-check my stomach feeling and other
possibly biased obersvations of nature in my surroundings.

The final goal her would be to have some automated script / service that posts
regular updates about certain key climate statistics about selected places of my
interest.
